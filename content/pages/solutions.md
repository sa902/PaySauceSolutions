## Main challenge
### About the code
The code is for a Titanium JS Alloy app. 
Alloy is an MVC application framework by TiDev for the Titanium SDK. (https://github.com/tidev/alloy)
Overall architecture is **MVC** 

The code provides a way to show and manage employee information, payroll settings, and related rules. It handles data retrieval, user interactions, and data saving.

#### Page.json
page.json provides the overall structure and configuration for the employee modules defined in a json object.

While it is incomplete, the template object provides overall structure and defines things found in html such as title, favicon etc. The empty `body` section implies that this configuration file has no associated html body structure and the HTML content is stored in a differant file or dynamically generated. 

`defaultPage` specifies URL mappings to pages. In this case, the wildcard maps everything to `employee-page`
`pages` defines all pages in the web app, we have one, with associated models,views and controllers.
`modules` tells us any specific modules used on the page, we can see some inohuse modules and UI libraries.
Similiarly, `handlers` tells us any handlers to handle tasks on the page.

The `js` and `css` arrays are empty but would contain any files relevant to the module.
`sockets` shows that web sockets are not used  here.
