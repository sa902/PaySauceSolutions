### SQL Question Test
This SQL query appears to be selecting data from one or more tables to retrieve distinct combinations of 'period_id' and 'employee_id' that meet certain conditions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The inner query:
   - This part of the query is enclosed in parentheses and acts as a subquery.
   - It selects distinct combinations of 'period_id' and 'employee_id' from two tables, 'period' (aliased as 'p') and 'txn' (aliased as 't').
   - It only selects rows where the 'state' column in the 'period' table is equal to 1.
   - It adds a computed column 'type' with a constant value of 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE' for each row selected from 'txn'.

2. The subquery alias 'op':
   - The results of the inner query are aliased as 'op'.

3. The main query:
   - It selects distinct combinations of 'period_id' and 'employee_id' from the 'op' subquery.
   - It performs a left join with the 'txn' table (aliased as 't') based on three conditions:
     - 'op.period_id' is equal to 't.period_id'.
     - 'op.employee_id' is equal to 't.employee_id'.
     - 'op.type' is equal to 't.type'.
   - The purpose of this left join is to find matching rows in the 'txn' table that have the same 'period_id', 'employee_id', and 'type'. The 'left join' means that all rows from 'op' are retained, and matching rows from 'txn' are included.

4. The WHERE clause:
   - It filters the results to include only rows where 't.type' is null.
   - This condition effectively filters out the rows where a match was found in the 'txn' table (where 't.type' is not null), leaving only those combinations of 'period_id' and 'employee_id' from 'op' that don't have corresponding entries in 'txn' with a non-null 'type'.

In summary, the query retrieves distinct combinations of 'period_id' and 'employee_id' from the 'op' subquery, but only those combinations that don't have corresponding entries in the 'txn' table with a non-null 'type'. This could be used, for example, to find 'period_id' and 'employee_id' pairs that are missing certain types of entries in the 'txn' table.

``` sql
-- Create the 'period' table
CREATE TABLE period (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    state INT
);

-- Create the 'txn' table
CREATE TABLE txn (
    period_id INT,
    employee_id INT,
    type VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data into the 'period' table
INSERT INTO period (id, state) VALUES
    (1, 1),
    (2, 0),
    (3, 1),
    (4, 1);

-- Insert sample data into the 'txn' table
INSERT INTO txn (period_id, employee_id, type) VALUES
    (1, 101, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE'),
    (2, 102, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE'),
    (3, 101, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE'),
    (4, 103, 'PT_OTHER_TYPE');

INSERT INTO period (id, state) VALUES
    (5, 0),
    (6, 1),
    (7, 1),
    (8, 0);

-- Insert additional sample data into the 'txn' table
INSERT INTO txn (period_id, employee_id, type) VALUES
    (5, 102, 'PT_OTHER_TYPE'),
    (6, 103, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE'),
    (7, 104, 'PT_OTHER_TYPE'),
    (8, 105, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE');
-- The provided query
SELECT DISTINCT op.period_id, op.employee_id
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT t.period_id, t.employee_id, 'PT_AC_ACC_LEAVE' AS type
    FROM period p
    JOIN txn t ON p.id = t.period_id
    WHERE p.state = 1
) op
LEFT JOIN txn t ON op.period_id = t.period_id AND op.employee_id = t.employee_id AND op.type = t.type
WHERE t.type IS NULL;
